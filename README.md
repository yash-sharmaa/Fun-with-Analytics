Climate scientists have measured the concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the Earth’s atmosphere dating back thousands of years.
In this project, I have investigated two datasets containing information about the carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere. We will specifically look at the increase in carbon dioxide levels over the past hundred years relative to the variability in levels of CO2 in the atmosphere over eight millennia.
These data are calculated by analyzing ice cores. Over time, gas gets trapped in the ice of Antarctica. Scientists can take samples of that ice and see how much carbon is in it. The deeper you go into the ice, the farther back in time you can analyze!
The first dataset comes from World Data Center for Paleoclimatology, Boulder and NOAA Paleoclimatology Program and describes the carbon dioxide levels back thousands of years “Before Present” (BP) or before January 1, 1950.

The second dataset explores carbon dioxide starting at year zero up until the recent year of 2014. This dataset was compiled by the Institute for Atmospheric and Climate Science (IAC) at Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule in Zürich, Switzerland.
